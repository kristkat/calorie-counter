# calorie-counter
 The idea is to implement an app which counts calories of products. It's not something new, it's just a try to create a fully functioning app using new technologies.
 App should have following features:
 + Save new products to the database
 + 2 input fields for weight and product(new or saved one) from which calorias are calculated
 + possibility to take photo of nutritions fields on the product package and automatically create a new item in the database
 + possibility to put you weight and graphs to represent it
 + check if there is plato effect and suggest smth
 + count calories for a day and make suggestions what lacks
 + count calories for a mixed dish and save the dish
